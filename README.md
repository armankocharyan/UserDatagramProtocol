# UserDatagramProtocol
Simple demonstration of UDP using java

Abstract:
The problem this project is trying to solve is the ability to communicate between three processes (Client, IntermediateHost, Server). To
Solve this problem a UDP communication model was created using Java DatagramSocket and Java Datagram libraries.

To Run the project:
-Install Eclipse IDE from https://www.eclipse.org/ide/
-Open Eclipse IDE and import the "UserDatagramProtocol" as a java project
-run the main method in the IntermediateHost Class and then Server Class
-Once the main methods in IntermediateHost and Server classes are running run the main method in the Client class
-Switch between the consoles to see the outputs generated by each process 

For the UML diagrams or the assignment description please check the UserDatagramProtocol main directory

Note:
Make sure all three programs are terminated before the launching the IntermediateHost -> Server -> Client
